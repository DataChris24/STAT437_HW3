<h1>STAT 437 - Homework 3</h1>

Homework assignment 3 from STAT 437 - High Dimensional Learning and Visualization taken from Washington State University's Global Campus during the Spring 2022 semester and was taught by Dr. Xiongzhi Chen.

This assignment's intended purpose was to become familiar with K-means clustering with the use of the `cluster` package and hierarchical clustering with the `ggdendro` package and a provided source file `Plotggdendro.r` (which allows for customization of the dendrogram).

I chose to create my own report style submission, rather than use the provided R markdown template to populate with my own code and answers. I also modified the `Plotggdendro.r` file to use official Washington State University colors.

## Built With

- ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-4.1.1-blue?style=plastic&logo=r)


Docker compose and supporting files included for the ability to run RStudio within a web browser without having to install RStudio locally.

## Getting Started

There are two options to be able to run the attached R markdown code files. Run locally with RStudio or run with the attached Docker container definition.

- **NOTE:** The `devtools` package requires many system packages as dependencies before successful installation. It's purpose is to document all pacakages and their versions and is not required to view and run the main pieces of the project code. The `devtools` package is used in the last code chunk of the `.rmd` file and can be removed, or you can use the Docker container defined in the `docker-compose.yaml` file to run the file with RStudio in a web browser.

### Running Locally

1. Have R and RStudio installed on your system
2. Download the `.rmd` file(s) and open with RStudio
3. Install any packages needed that aren't already installed. 

### Running With Docker Container

#### Prerequisites

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
2. Create or sign into a Docker account.

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository 

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DataChris24/STAT437_HW3.git
   ```
2. In your terminal navigate to the root folder of the repo and run 

   ```
   docker compose up
   ```

   If you have tried to build this container and had any issues, you may need to run the following code to ensure you get a clean rebuild of the container (though you shouldn't have any issues).

   ```
   docker compose build --no-cache && docker compose up -d --force-recreate
   ```

   **NOTE:** There will be a `data` folder that is contained in the container build. This data is used for the `STAT437_Project1` repository's code. This folder was built into the container due to the large size of the file and because I built the container to be reused for all the projects done for the STAT 437 course.
3. When the container `cmimsstat437` has been started, navigate to your web browser of choice and go to<br>
   `http://localhost:8787`
   <br>**OR**<br>
   `http://your.ip.address.here:8787` <- This is used for Windows machines or if using a Mac or Linix based machine and `localhost` does not work.

4. When the webpage loads<br>
    - username = `rstuido` <br>
    - password = `Password1`

5. Once inside RStuido navigate to the `projects` folder in the `Files` pane (bottom right window)

6. Select either the `Mims_Chris_STAT_437_HW3.Rmd` file or the `stat437_HW3.Rmd` file to interact with the file and run each of the code blocks. **NOTE:* The first file mentioned is my work while the latter is the file supplied by Dr. Chen as a template.

7. Once you are done interacting with the file, close the browser and in your terminal run 
   
   ```
   docker compose down
   ```

   This will shut down and remove the Docker container.

Also, the PDF and/or HTML output(s) of these R markdown files have also been included in the repository for review without the need to run the code in RStudio or through the use of the Docker container.

## Usage

The purpose of this project is to show my ability to not only use R and the included packages but also my ability to create professional documentation using markdown. The `devtools` package allows for specific citing of packages and their version for reproducable results. 

## Contributing

Since this is not an ongoing project, there will be no ability to contribute further to the project.
